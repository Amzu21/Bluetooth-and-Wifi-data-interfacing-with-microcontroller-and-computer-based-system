# Bluetooth-and-Wifi-data-interfacing-with-microcontroller-and-computer-based-system

  In this experiment, we interface data to a microcontroller and computer-based system via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. The objective is to create a remote temperature monitoring and control system using a microcontroller ESP32 (this microcontroller has embedded Bluetooth and Wi-Fi modules), and a temperature sensor LM35. The outputs or temperature readings will be displayed on a smartphone with Bluetooth and Wi-fi capabilities on an app. Using this method, we can monitor our data remotely as long as the system is connected to the User Interface application.
